# option-pricing

This package currently include American/European/barrier options with finite-difference scheme.
The FD scheme currently only works for single-dimensional option, while Monte-Carlo supports higher-dimensional Basket options. 

### American Option
We use Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm to price Basket American options. The primal-dual algorithms is not included for computation cost reason.

### European Option
Tuning LVM and calibration of implied volatility.


**Next step:** Working on small-scale test file, as well as schema of implied volatility calibration.
